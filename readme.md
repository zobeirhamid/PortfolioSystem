## About this project

I build this Application to learn using Laravel and Vue. It covers the following technologies:
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
- JWT Authentication
- A REST Api
- TDD in the Backend
- Selectable Items to order the position of the projects
- Uploading from zips and images

## Functionality

Basically this is a project to upload one's projects. It is possible to upload designs as JPG, PNG or GIF (I think) and HTMl Websites as ZIP, they get automatically unzipped and provided an URL.
Also you get an API of your projects (/api/projects).
